                    This year a solo dance competition was held by our school in the month of October. A single-member
                    could participate from a single class and will be representing the entire class. The rules were
                    simple. The dance need not be classical, semiclassical or of any particular type.
                    It could be a mix of different varieties of dance forms. It could even be hip-hop. The time allotted
                    was 7 minutes. Costumes should not be vulgar but should be neat also costumes were not compulsory.
                    The dance should be entertaining. Use of dangerous materials during the dance was prohibited.

                    We all have friends in our lives. It can be a friend from school, a friend in our neighbourhood, or
                    a pen friend who lives far away. We mostly love and care for our friends, but we also fight with
                    them sometimes and do not want to talk to them for a while. Though it is true that fights are common
                    in any kind of friendship, it is also important to remember that we must cherish the good memories
                    and try to forget the bad ones.

                    this is me while riding a motorbike in the middle of the night to enjoy a quiet night atmosphere. I
                    like riding at night because it feels so relaxing.
                    All the local kids who knew him went to his house one sunny day to see this new bike. He lived on
                    one of the posh roads and had a long back garden with a concrete path running up from the big lawn
                    at the bottom. </p>
